<h2>Fork Information</h2>

<p>This fork adds <strong>video thumbnail generation</strong> to FileBrowser.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cody82/filebrowser/tree/videopreview">this fork</a> by cody82, but further customized.</p>

<h3>Customizations include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Thumbnails are stored in a <code>.thumbnails</code> subfolder, alongside the existing cache mechanism.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> is dynamically selected based on the OS for maximum compatibility:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linux</strong>: VA-API</li>
      <li><strong>Windows</strong>: DXVA2</li>
      <li><strong>Mac</strong>: VideoToolbox</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thumbnail generation <strong>pauses when leaving a folder</strong>, allowing new folders to start processing without waiting for previous ones to finish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FFmpeg</strong> is required.</li>
  <li>The <strong>ctx utility</strong> is used to handle stopping thumbnail generation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>22-Feb-25</strong> â€“ This fork will now be <strong>automatically kept up to date</strong> via GitHub Actions.</li>
  <li>The following files were modified:
    <ul>

      <li><code>/frontend/src/components/files/ListingItem.vue</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>ChatGPT was heavily involved in generating the code.</p>
<p>Although I have programming experience and even a <strong>software engineering degree</strong>, my career path led me to <strong>IT and System Administration</strong>.</p>
<p>This is my <strong>first real experience with Golang</strong>, so go easy on me! ðŸ˜…</p>

File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview and edit your files. It is a **create-your-own-cloud**-kind of software where you can just install it on your server, direct it to a path and access your files through a nice web interface.
