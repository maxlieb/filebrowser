<h2>Fork Information</h2>

<p>This fork adds <strong>video thumbnail generation</strong> to FileBrowser.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cody82/filebrowser/tree/videopreview">this fork</a> by cody82, but further customized.</p>

<h3>Customizations include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Thumbnails are stored in a <code>.thumbnails</code> subfolder, alongside the existing cache mechanism.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> is dynamically selected based on the OS for maximum compatibility:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linux</strong>: VA-API</li>
      <li><strong>Windows</strong>: DXVA2</li>
      <li><strong>Mac</strong>: VideoToolbox</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thumbnail generation <strong>pauses when leaving a folder</strong>, allowing new folders to start processing without waiting for previous ones to finish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FFmpeg</strong> is required.</li>
  <li>The <strong>ctx utility</strong> is used to handle stopping thumbnail generation.</li>
</ul>
